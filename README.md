# Retail-Store-DBMS
An online retail store database management system. 
It is a fully fledged model covering most necessities of businesses, ranging from information about customers, products, suppliers, orders and different stores. We have initialized various queries to check out products and stores for items, and also view the office staff while keeping in mind their privacy. Our data model also handles online deliveries making customer addresses and orders a part of our schema. We have a UI made using HTML, CSS & PHP. Customers, suppliers, stores and admins can login using their IDs and passwords. Based on their privileges they can view data. Admins are given full authority over the data, and they can use the text field to input unique queries to manage the database. We also have used indexing to quickly access important data from the system. Along with some sql queries we also have four embedded queries given as buttons.
